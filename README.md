# web-hh

This is going to be the website-repository for the web-hh.github.io website.

The web-hh project is an effort to bring the different web-related communities
in Hamburg together and to enable more people to engange in community-building
activities. 

We want to provide help, information and starting-points for everyone who wants
to start organizing events or help with the many existing events in hamburg.


## Code of conduct

The events organized by this group as well as all online-activities should be
welcoming and provide a great experience for everyone who wants to join.

To this end we will establish a code of conduct as well as guidelines for
moderators and organizers about how to deal with violations.
Working on these issues has just begun and we will update this page as progress
is made. 


## Slack

We use [slack][] for most communication. If you want to join, the best thing
would be to start with subscribing to the slack-channel. Just enter your
